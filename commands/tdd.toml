# TDD Command

This command invokes the **tdd-guide** agent to enforce test-driven development methodology.

## What This Command Does

1. **Scaffold Interfaces** - Define types/interfaces first
2. **Generate Tests First** - Write failing tests (RED)
3. **Implement Minimal Code** - Write just enough to pass (GREEN)
4. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)
5. **Verify Coverage** - Ensure 80%+ test coverage

## When to Use

Use `/tdd` when:
- Implementing new features
- Adding new functions/components
- Fixing bugs (write test that reproduces bug first)
- Refactoring existing code
- Building critical business logic

## How It Works

The tdd-guide agent will:

1. **Define interfaces** for inputs/outputs
2. **Write tests that will FAIL** (because code doesn't exist yet)
3. **Run tests** and verify they fail for the right reason
4. **Write minimal implementation** to make tests pass
5. **Run tests** and verify they pass
6. **Refactor** code while keeping tests green
7. **Check coverage** and add more tests if below 80%

## TDD Cycle

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → REPEAT

RED:      Write a failing test
GREEN:    Write minimal code to pass
REFACTOR: Improve code, keep tests passing
REPEAT:   Next feature/scenario
```

## TDD Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Write the test FIRST, before any implementation
- ✅ Run tests and verify they FAIL before implementing
- ✅ Write minimal code to make tests pass
- ✅ Refactor only after tests are green
- ✅ Add edge cases and error scenarios
- ✅ Aim for 80%+ coverage (100% for critical code)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Write implementation before tests
- ❌ Skip running tests after each change
- ❌ Write too much code at once
- ❌ Ignore failing tests
- ❌ Test implementation details (test behavior)
- ❌ Mock everything (prefer integration tests)

## Important Notes

**MANDATORY**: Tests must be written BEFORE implementation. The TDD cycle is:

1. **RED** - Write failing test
2. **GREEN** - Implement to pass
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve code

Never skip the RED phase. Never write code before tests.
